# INFO40975-AI-Final-Research-Project---BikeDataset
This is a Repository for my final Research project for the INFO40975 Artificial Inteligence class at Sheridan College

In this project, we developed a predictive model to estimate hourly bike rental demand for a bike-sharing service. Using the PyCaret library, we compared several regression models to determine the best model. The CatBoost Regressor had the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These results suggest the model's strong potential to refine the service's inventory management and meet customer demand effectively.
