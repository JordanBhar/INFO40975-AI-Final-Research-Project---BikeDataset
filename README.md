# INFO40975-AI-Final-Research-Project---BikeDataset
This is a Repository for my final Research project for the INFO40975 Artificial Inteligence class at Sheridan College

This study focused on constructing a predictive model for a bike-sharing service, aiming to accurately forecast the hourly demand for rental bikes. Utilizing the PyCaret automated machine learning library, a comparison of differnt regression models was performed. The primary goal of this research assignment was to identify a model that could determine demand predictions using the bike sharing dataset, thereby facilitating optimal inventory management and enhancing customer service for bike sharing. The CatBoost Regressor was identified as the the best, achieving the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).These metrics are important for minimizing mistakes for preditions. a minimal MAE indicates proximity between predictions and actual values, and a minimal RMSE underscores the model's capability to mitigate the impact of significant errors. The implementation of the catboost model looks to improve the bike-sharing service's ability to predict demand with greater precision, thus improving operational efficiency and resource deployment.
